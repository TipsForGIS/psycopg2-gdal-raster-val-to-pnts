# psycopg2-gdal-raster-val-to-pnts
The code assumes you have a proper raster file and a point table in Postgres, and both are in the same projection. The code uploads the raster file into Postgres using the raster2pgsql command. Then it will create a copy table of the point table with an additional column called rast_val. This new column is then updated with pixel values intersecting with the points.
